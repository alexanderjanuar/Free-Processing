# Free-processing
Preprocessing is an essential step in machine learning as it helps to clean, prepare, and transform raw data into a format suitable for modelling. However, preprocessing can be a time-consuming and challenging task, especially for beginners. To simplify this process, a simple preprocessing interface for machine learning modelling can be developed.

The interface would allow users to easily preprocess data with just a few clicks. It would have several features such as handling missing values, scaling and normalization, handling categorical variables,removing duplicates, and removing outliers.

As of now, here is some features from the program:
- Text Preprocessing
  - Data Cleaning
    - Handling missing values
    - Removing duplicates
    - Removing outliers
  - Data Transformation
    - Scaling
    - Encoding
  - Data Reduction
